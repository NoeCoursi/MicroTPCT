    "#### Input files\n",
    "For this interactive tutorial, we provide fake data especially made to test the pipeline.\n",
    "* **Target :** `proteome.fasta` is a UniProt-like [1] Fasta file. If needed, you can also provide a tabular format containing accessions and sequences, explicitly specifying the column names.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Wildcards\n",
    "Sometimes, the target file may contain ambigous amino acids. In this case, it is very likely that the wildcard symbol will be an `X`. This is why, **microTPCT** offer the option of a wildcard-aware matching. *In any case, MicroTPCT will inform you if your target file contains wildcard symbol, even if you set `allow_wildcard` on `False`*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matching engines\n",
    "MicroTPCT has several matching engines, which vary in speed and RAM consumption depending on how you use them and your input files. In most cases, the aho-corasick algorithm should be suitable `matching_engine = \"aho\"`. *For more details about matching engines performances, please refer to the “Benchmark” section of the `README`.*"
