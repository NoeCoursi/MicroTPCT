    "\n",
    "Just below, some information about them :\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input files\n",
    "For this interactive tutorial, we provide synthetic data specifically designed to test the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target**: `proteome.fasta` is a UniProt-like [1] FASTA file. Alternatively, you may provide a tabular file containing accessions and sequences, explicitly specifying the column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query**: `peptides.xlsx` is by default a Proline [2] output file, but any tabular format can be used as long as it contains an accession column and a sequence column, which must be explicitly specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wildcards\n",
    "Sometimes, the target file may contain ambiguous amino acids. In most proteomics datasets, the wildcard symbol is typically `X`.  \n",
    "For this reason, MicroTPCT offers an optional wildcard-aware matching mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, MicroTPCT will inform you if your target file contains wildcard symbols, even if `allow_wildcard` is set to False.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matching engines\n",
    "MicroTPCT provides several matching engines that differ in speed and memory consumption depending on the size and structure of the input data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In most use cases, the Aho–Corasick algorithm (`matching_engine = \"aho\"`) provides an excellent trade-off between speed and memory efficiency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed performance comparisons, please refer to the “Benchmark” section of the README."
