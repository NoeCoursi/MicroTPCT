Usage:
  microtpct <command> [options] QUERY_input TARGET_input

Description:
  MicroTPCT is a bioinformatics toolkit designed to identify and evaluate
  candidate microproteins by matching peptides from alternative proteomes
  against canonical proteomes using multiple matching strategies. This
  software enables to process wildcards in the target file using option -r

Commands:

  aho   (default)    Perform Aho–Corasick based peptide matching
  bm		         Perform Boyer-Moore based peptide matching
  ag                 Perform [AWk - GREP] based peptide matching
  blast              Perform local BLAST-based peptide matching
  regex              Perform regex-based based peptide matching
  				       ->  not recommended as the primary algorithm
  				           better used as option
  start				 Setup the sowtware in your machine

General options:

  -h, --help        Show this help message and exit
  -v, --version     Show program version and exit
  --log FILE        Write logs to FILE
  --error FILE      Write errors to FILE
  --mode [mode]		dev or prod

  -r 				Complementary regex search only undetermined 
  					amino-acids from target file

  -o output_file 	Defines ouput file path. If not provided,
  					an output folder will be created in the parent 
  					directory of the current working directory.
