Usage:
  microTPCT [options] QUERY_input TARGET_input

Description:
  MicroTPCT is a bioinformatics toolkit designed to identify and evaluate
  candidate microproteins by matching peptides from alternative proteomes
  against canonical proteomes using multiple matching strategies. This
  software enables to process wildcards in the target file using option -r

Options:

  --aho   (default)    Perform Aho–Corasick based peptide matching
  --bm		             Perform Boyer-Moore based peptide matching
  --ag                 Perform [AWk - GREP] based peptide matching
  --blast              Perform local BLAST-based peptide matching
  --regex              Perform regex-based based peptide matching
  				                ->  not recommended as the primary algorithm
  				                better used as option

General options:
  --start				       Setup the software in your machine, install dependencies
  -h, --help        Show this help message and exit
  --version     Show program version and exit
  --log FILE        Write logs to FILE
  --error FILE      Write errors to FILE
  
  -r 				Complementary regex search only undetermined 
  					amino-acids from target file

  -o output_file 	Defines ouput file path. If not provided,
  					an output folder will be created in the parent 
  					directory of the current working directory.
